# execenv.fedora.iot
Ansible Execution Environment for Fedora IoT

## Requirements

Use of this requires both [ansible-runner](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-runner)
and [ansible-builder](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-builder). You will
also need a container runtime engine such as [podman](https://podman.io/) or
[docker](https://www.docker.com/).
